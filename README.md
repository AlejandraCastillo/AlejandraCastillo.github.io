# 👋 Hi, I'm María Alejandra Castillo Martínez

[*¿Prefieres leer esto en español?*](README.es.md)

**Software Engineer in Training \|  Low-Level Systems Enthusiast**
Passionate about clean architecture, logical design, and deep learning. Currently developing memory allocator simulators in C as part of my transition from Android development into the world of systems programming.

## 🧠 About Me

I’m autistic (level 1) and I channel my hyperfocus and conceptual thinking into building clear, functional, and well-structured solutions. I believe in code that can be _read_ (not deciphered), in the importance of technical quality, and in environments that support autonomy, order, and deep learning.

## 🚀 Projects

### 🔢 [Allocator Laboratory](https://github.com/AlejandraCastillo/AllocatorLaboratory) _(In progress)_

**Memory allocator simulators in C**  
Modular project to explore the internal logic of different memory allocation and deallocation strategies. Includes approaches such as fixed-size blocks with bitmap, coalescing, buddy system, slab, among others.

---

### 🧮 [My Calculator](https://github.com/AlejandraCastillo/MyCalculator) _(Paused)_

**Modular calculator with MVVM architecture and unit tests**  
Designed from scratch with a clear separation between logic and UI, respecting operator precedence.  
Includes extensive unit testing and a clean, decoupled design focus.

---

### ⏱ [TimeOutApp](https://github.com/AlejandraCastillo/TimeOutApp) _(Paused)_

**App to break hyperfocus using overlays and passphrases**  
Implements a foreground service with conscious validation before exiting blocking mode.  
Designed to support self-regulation for neurodivergent minds.

---

## 🗺 Roadmap

- Complete all levels of the `Allocator Laboratory` project
    
- Learn Makefile and advanced testing techniques in C
    
- Write technical articles on allocator design
    
- Integrate the simulators into an educational Android app
    

---

## 🧪 Latest Learnings

- How Android overlays work at the system level
    
- Memory simulation design using bitmaps
    
- That good architecture can make a calculator exciting
    
- That paused projects also count, when they’re well built
